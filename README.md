## Project Overview
This is a **scalable end-to-end big data pipeline** to analyze **Apple App Store applications** using **Apache Spark**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **PostgreSQL**.  

The goal was to extract insights about **application categories, pricing strategies, update cadence, and popularity trends**. The entire workflow is **cloud-ready** and can be automated through a batch script.

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** Apple App Store Dataset (~1.2M+ rows)  
- **Source:** Kaggle (public dataset)  
- **Format:** CSV uploaded into **Azure Blob Storage**  
- **Features:** App name, category, size, price, ratings, last update, etc.

## Major Steps Followed
1. **Dataset Upload** ‚Äì Uploaded the Apple App Store dataset into **Azure Blob Storage**.  
2. **Spark Ingestion** ‚Äì Initialized a Spark session and retrieved data directly from Blob.

3. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Cleaned null values, standardized types, handled outliers.  
4. **Database Storage** ‚Äì Loaded the curated data into **PostgreSQL** for structured persistence.

5. **Data Export** ‚Äì Extracted PostgreSQL tables into CSV for downstream analysis.  
6. **Exploratory Visualizations** ‚Äì Created plots using Python/Seaborn and Tableau dashboards.  
7. **Automation** ‚Äì Built an automated ETL pipeline triggered by a batch script.

## Conclusion and Further Scope
This project demonstrated how **Spark + Azure Blob + PostgreSQL** can handle large-scale app data efficiently. It revealed insights into **app size, pricing, update patterns, and user ratings**.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- App category and size strongly affect usage and ratings.  
- Free apps attract slightly better ratings than paid ones.  
- Update frequency varies widely across categories.  

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** of app reviews with NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa).  
- Extend pipeline to **real-time streaming** using Kafka/Spark Structured Streaming.  
- Add **predictive modeling** for ratings and churn detection.  
- Containerize and orchestrate with **Docker + Airflow** for production.
